# Forecasting the sales of a supermarket

## Task
A supermarket has various departments, and it must
stock up items that will be in demand in
each of these departments. However, while
stocking up, it must make sure that it does
not have excessive stock. 

## Solution:

To tackle this task, I have used Power BI to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze the supermarket's data.

**Sales Analysis**: This component involved the analysis of historical sales data. It helped to identify trends such as top-selling category and subcategory of products, peak sales periods, YoY Sales Growth % and the best performing regions. This information was essential for predicting future sales patterns and understanding the factors influencing sales performance.

**Inventory Management and Sales Optimisation**: This section focused on analyzing the supermarket's inventory data. It looked at frequently ordered products, their reorder cycle levels to identify and tackle potential overstock and understock situations. It helped to optimize inventory levels, ensuring that the supermarket had the right quantity of the right items, thus reducing waste and storage costs.
